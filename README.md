# PCAviaK-MeansClustering

Q. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Dataset: You can choose any dataset of your interest from publicly available datasets or use your own dataset.

Tasks:
- Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, scaling, etc.
- Implement PCA from scratch using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib, and apply it to the dataset.
- Use the scikit-learn library to apply PCA to the dataset and compare the results with the implementation from scratch.
- Visualize the results of PCA using Matplotlib or any other visualization library of your choice.
- Evaluate the performance of PCA by calculating the explained variance ratio for each principal component and selecting the appropriate number of principal components for the dataset.
- Use the selected number of principal components to reconstruct the original dataset and calculate the reconstruction error.
- Compare the results of PCA with and without dimensionality reduction using a classification algorithm of your choice, such as logistic regression, k-means clustering, or support vector machines.
- Write a brief report summarizing your findings and observations.

A.
K-Means Clustering and PCA of Human Activity Recognition

Intro

In this project I will use my knowledge of clustering and PCA algorithms to explore the Human Activity Recognition dataset. 

Dataset info

Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (*WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING*) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

NOTE:
To execute the model download the code and change the path for the Dataset info to whichever .csv file consists the history of dataset information for training and testing purposes of the machine. For reference, train.csv has been added for usage.
