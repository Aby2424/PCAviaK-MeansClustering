# PCAviaK-MeansClustering

Q. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Dataset: You can choose any dataset of your interest from publicly available datasets or use your own dataset.

Tasks:
- Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, scaling, etc.
- Implement PCA from scratch using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib, and apply it to the dataset.
- Use the scikit-learn library to apply PCA to the dataset and compare the results with the implementation from scratch.
- Visualize the results of PCA using Matplotlib or any other visualization library of your choice.
- Evaluate the performance of PCA by calculating the explained variance ratio for each principal component and selecting the appropriate number of principal components for the dataset.
- Use the selected number of principal components to reconstruct the original dataset and calculate the reconstruction error.
- Compare the results of PCA with and without dimensionality reduction using a classification algorithm of your choice, such as logistic regression, k-means clustering, or support vector machines.
- Write a brief report summarizing your findings and observations.
